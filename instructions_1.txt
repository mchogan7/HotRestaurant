Instructions:

Phase I: For this first phase, aim to write out the 
pieces that will need to be programmed to create 
the functionality of your application. Try to break 
it into 6-7 pieces.
Instructors/TAs: Once time is up have students share 
their breakdowns. As a suggestion, here is a list 
that you can slack them.

1. Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, 
	reservation form, and reservation views.

2. Create a basic server using Express.JS

3. Create a few array variables that will hold the data

4. Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data

5. Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages

6. Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from 
	users to the Express server
